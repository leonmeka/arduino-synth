A micro-controller based synthesizer leveraging the Web Serial API.

# Description
This web application allows for generation of an oscillating audio signal, which can be modified through nodes as exposed by the ´Web Audio´ API. Operations can be applied via dedicated knob inputs on a micro controller (e.g. Arduino).
